Exercise for MSCH-C220

Okay so the extra stuff i've done was, created all my own assets, added a background image start, end and playing screen, as well as a pause putton (escape), both background music as well as sound effects that go off when you shoot the enemy shoots and you destory an asteriod. I think that was it, i ran out of time at edisons for him to help me figure out a second level
